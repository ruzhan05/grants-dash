A web application system that uses Puppeteer for web scrapping to extract data from the websites that provide grants information. The data includes grants informations such as: Grant name, type, funding organization, category, grant opening date and grant closing date. After extracting the data and filtering them, the data is then visualized in the front end in the form of analysis using React components. The anaylsis provides and in depth idea od the grants information that has been obtained from the websites. The extracted data is stored in the database inside the Mongoose models. The data is fetched in the front end by API calls. The technology used for backend is NodeJs. Overall, this system aims to assit the researchers looking for grants by providing them a real time analysis of the grants that are available according to their needs and allow them to apply for the grants they have selected.

<u>Technologies used:</u> **React, NodeJs, Puppeteer, ExpressJs, MongoDB.**
